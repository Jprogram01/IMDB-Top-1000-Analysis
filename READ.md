# Overview

{Provide a description of the data set that you are analyzing.  Include the link of where you obtained the data.}
I analyzed a dataset of top 1000 movies in an IMDB list.

{Describe your purpose for writing this software to analyze the data.}
I wanted to better understand the relationship that movies have in it's ratings and other variables of the movie.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the data set, the questions and answers, the code running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Data Analysis Results

1: Is there a pattern between the decade a movie it was released in, and the rating it recieves on IMDB for the top 1000 movies in IMDB?

There is not much of a relationship between the two, but the earliest decade of 1920 and the latest decade of 2010/2020 tend to rate slightly better.

2: What is the relationship between how much a movie grosses and the decade its in?

There is a definite increase in how much a movie grosses and how what decade it is in, there is a increase in amount of money grossed as the decades grow newer.
# Development Environment

I used Python. For tools and libraries I used pandas, numpy, altair and quarto

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* Examine relationsip between rating and amount grossed
* Add another line in the gross and decade comparison graph with the inflation through the years
* Develop a ML model that can try and predict what decade a movie was released based on it's other variables.
